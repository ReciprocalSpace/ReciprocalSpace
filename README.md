ReciprocalSpace
---------------
Hey! I'm ReciprocalSpace!

Iâ€™m interested in nerdy stuff, like physics, and math! I develop several libraries to help my colleagues (and I!) analyse their data for their academic research.
If any of these libraries can be of use to you, please feel free use it! And if you'd like to contribute, even better!

My ambitions for the foreseeable future :
- Getting better at implementing design patterns
- Developing new skills in data science and Machine Learning

*"What's a reciprocal space ?"* you may ask?

The reciprocal space (or lattice) represents the Fourier transform of another lattice. It's one of the key concepts of Magnetic Resonance Imaging, and Solid-state physics, which are precisely my area of research! I develop superconducting coils for Magnetic Resonance Imaging.


My projects so far...
---------------------
- pycoilib : inductance calculator for coils of arbitrary geometries in space
- caracnl : caracterization of the non-linear electrical properties of superconducting resonators using Vector Network Analyser data and a non-linear model (Thomas,2020)
- vlf-mri : data analysis of Fast Field Cycling Nuclear Magnetic Resonance data acquired with a Stelar Relaxometer
