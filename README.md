Hi, I’m @ReciprocalSpace,

I’m interested in nerdy stuff, like physics, and math! I develop several libraries to help my colleagues (and I!) analyse their data for their academic research.
If any of these libraries can be of use to you, please use it! And if you'd like to contribute, even better!

My ambitions for the forseeable future :
- Getting better at implementing design patterns
- Developing new data skills in data science and Machine Learning!
